			<p><b>Bane (Tom Hardy)</b> — The first time I watched a film in IMAX was The Dark Knight Rises, a couple days after my 15th birthday. I still have the ticket stub for the movie. I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan for a long time, and even more so after watching this film. Only Nolan can make a not-your-typical superhero movie.</p>

			<p class="neg"><img src="/assets/projects/sketches/natalie.jpg" alt=""></p>
			<p><b>Natalie Portman</b> — Probably one of my favorite American actresses. I usually like British actors/actresses best, but Natalie is extra special.</p>

			<p><b>Jony Ive</b> — This guy is probably my idol. I dressed up as him for halloween (yes I shaved my head), but nobody understood my reference, so I changed it to Avatar the Last Airbender (the show everybody at my school watched, except for me). I had to live with a bald head for three weeks after that, but it was worth it.</p>
