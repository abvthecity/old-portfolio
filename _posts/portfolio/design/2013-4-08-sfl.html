				<b style="font-size:120%">Around the time that my Sophomore year in high school began, Cameron Loftis approached me to help him with forming his club’s web-based interfaces.</b> He was very passionate about public speaking, and wanted to create a club dedicated to spreading that passion. He reached towards technology to accomplish his goals. Throughout the fall of 2012 I designed his club’s website, t-shirt and identity. The first thing I did was design a memorable logo that would represent the team. I chose to draw a torch because it symbolized empowerment, integrity, enlightenment and hope, and it resembled a microphone. The circular lines represents the spreading audiowaves from one epicenter— the team. The design resonated well with the team, so we used it for websites, t-shirts and flyers.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, I was developing the first version of the club's website. In v1.0, I wanted to bring a professional and clean look that immediately communicates purpose and mission. The first thing a user would see is an introductory carousel. The first image will blend into the background of the first section of the page. A short statement follows to give the user an immediate idea of what the organization is about. The full mission statement is contained in an index-card-like box that would remind the user of making speeches on index cards.

			<p>The about page features the list of team members. I designed these to look like business cards, and using <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry.js</a> to create a more fluid look.</p>
			<p class="neg"><span class="sidenotes"><img src="/assets/projects/sfl/tshirt.jpg" alt="" class="right-image"><span class="right-image-caption">T-shirt design; printed with <a href="http://customink.com" target="_blank">CustomInk.com</a>.</span></span></p>
			<p>The t&#8209;shirt took a week to do because I've never designed a t-shirt before, and we wanted to create something that looks and feels powerful. Cameron chose three words that he felt exemplified his organization's purpose: educate, empower, excel. I took multiple tries to incorporate these words in its intended effect. Using customink's tools, I created a button that resembled Siri. Surrounding that is the three words, revolving around the main idea: speaking. I felt this had an appropriate look because our logo was also in circular form. For budget purposes, we were restricted to one color. I chose green because the word "life" had a greenish characteristic, and the color paired well with the professional navy blue color.</p>
			<p>
				<b style="font-size:120%">It wasn't long before Cameron decided to contact me for a redesign.</b> His impression of using the site for a few months was its dull, lifeless characteristic. Something that does not live up to its powerful name. I agreed with his sentiment, and spent a few weeks of the summer of 2013 to completely rethink and rebuild the website. The first thing I did was to take the original black-and-white photograph of the <a href="http://www.portlandoccupier.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FreeSpeechMovement1964.jpg" target="_blank">1964 UC Berkeley Free Speech Movement</a> that I photoshopped earlier for version-1, bearing the title of the club, and play with it in Pixelmator. Using sepia and lens flare filters, I gave the black-and-white photograph more life and personality. Realizing that I wanted this photo to be more emphasized, I decided to blow up the website, giving each section a representative photograph. Using this opportunity, I also experimented with <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/" target="_blank">parallax</a>. The website is now the current site that can be accessed with the link below. I included a screenshot just in case.
