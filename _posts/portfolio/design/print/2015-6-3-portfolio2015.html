			<p style="text-align:center;">Forced to reflect on the past several years in my college application essays, I realized massive personal growth in my work, hobbies, and passions. As high school came to a smooth conclusion I threw together this physical portfolio booklet to represent a milestone and to remind myself of what I will strive to achieve in the next few years of university. Thank you for checking out my work.</p>
