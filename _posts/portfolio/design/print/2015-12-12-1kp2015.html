			<h5>What is 1000 Pitches?</h5>
			<p class="sans">1000 Pitches is a 2-month-long competition run by Spark SC and hosted by MPowered. The goal is to empower USC students from all backgrounds to think entreprenurially, ideate solutions to problems relevant to them, and be able to pitch their ideas to an audience. Ultimately, we wanted to reach our goal of 1000 pitches from 1000 students, which we did: <a href="http://1000pitches.com/usc" target="_blank">1174 count</a>.</p>
			<h5>About the Branding</h5>
			<p class="sans">This year our director of branding, Megan Park, set the tone for this year's 1000 pitches brand assets with subtle, gridded, blueprint-esque backdrops and a focus on white lines. My task was to design a targeted marketing strategy to gain participants within underrepresented communities at USC for entreprenurship. Instead of marketing towards engineers and business students, who make up the majority of our participants, we wanted to focus on cinema, art, music, and science students. These posters make up my effort to expand upon the brand, target unique communities, and tell a hidden story within each piece.</p>
