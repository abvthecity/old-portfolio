			<p style="text-align:center;">As a final act of desperation to appeal to CMU's waitlist, I threw together a portfolio booklet and I sent it to the admissions committee. Despite the misfortune that the SCS enrollment was complete, I'm left with a portfolio that represents my massive personal growth in my work throughout the past four years of high school. It is certainly a milestone that I can physically put away and embrace the next four years of growth at university.</p>
