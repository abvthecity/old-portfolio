				<b>Yearbook is not your typical class.</b> It’s a group of creative individuals that grows into a family.
			</p>

			<p>With distribution-date approaching, my yearbook team and I were busy alphabetizing and reorganizing 850 books. The operation was running smoothly until we all heard a loud gasp. One of the staff had opened her yearbook and realized that the pages were falling out. Panic ensued.</p>

			<p>When I stepped into Yearbook, I did not realize the imminent chaos that would occur: we had a new advisor, a new startup publisher, and a $15k inherited debt.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="sidenotes"><span class="left-image-caption">Colophon of fonts used throughout the book.</span></span>
				<img src="/assets/projects/yearbook-2014/colophon.jpg" alt="">
			</p>

<p>The year began with the goal of eradicating the $15k debt Leland accumulated from forty years with Jostens; we switched to Treering, a startup yearbook company that offered no quotas and an option to fundraise. We quickly realized how limited Treering's page creation software was, thus Barbara and I made the decision to create the entire book in Photoshop—despite that none of our design team subordinates had any experience with the software.</p>

<p>I was made co-editor for my experience in design, and I was tasked with guiding the design team and creating templates. My goal was to portray diversity and highlight the cultural synergy at my school through visual language. Titled “Come Together,” our 2013-2014 book featured vibrant, atmospheric backgrounds to signify cohesion and wholeness. Crossed lines and other similar motifs represented convergence, and handwritten quotes depicted the uniqueness of every person that came together within one community.</p>

				</span>
We then chose other typefaces that suited the different themes in the book. Melbourne, a sans-serif, is narrow, energetic—"Spirit." Hapna Mono is a slab serif that felt academic—"Campus." Franchise is brave and bold—"Athletics." Lobster, while funky, looked organic and complete in single-worded lower-case headings—"People." Sentinel was the perfect heading because it is simple, stylish, but not too modern. Retina Display and Aleo paired for copy and captions. Symbols, in Gotham, were assigned to sections as follows: / is spirit because it is edgy and nonysmmetrical, "×" is athletics because it represents teamwork, "|" is campus bcause of sense and neatness, "+" is people because it signifies relationships and togetherness.				</p>

				</span>
				The template was a collaboration between me and Barbara. We recognized that our school's culture was more driven to colors and spirit than simplicity and design. While we incorporated certain rules, our goal was to appeal to our content-craving audience.
			</p>
			<p>We chose to put 8-16 photos on each page to increase the exposure of students. The dominant photo on each spread is the one that bleeds off the edge. To keep the viewer's attention, we avoided dead, white, flat space in the background by selecting an atmospheric photograph, which we blurred and texturized. This created depth and vibrancy without distracting the viewer. We allowed designers to select one unifying color for all headings in the page. To make captions more findable, we switched from the tradition directions such as "top-left" to numbers. Photographs are 1 space away from each other, and captions are 3 spaces away from photographs, to increase reading comfort. The bottom-right corner, called the "folio," includes a faded photograph of an individual, and his or her quote, in order to increase student exposure, and decrease empty space. The template was later distributed to designers who all painstakingly converted their own designs to the unified version. And of course, the lines in the background are not mistakes— they are part of the recurring motifs for each section.</p>

			<p>Another sample of the publication design I contributed. This is the student spotlight that fills part of a page before the class mug shots of students begin. Not only did this design have to ease into the mugshots, it had to follow the motifs already prevalent throughout the book.</p>

				</span>
				For the dividers, Barbara gave me full control over what I wanted to do with it, so after I recieved the photos from the talented Tanveer Bains, I set out to bring as much personality to these pages as possible. Inspired by <a href="http://vimeo.com/87289244" target="_blank">a project by Trent Bell</a>, I knew the best measure of personality was the unique handwriting of each individual. A similar design was applied across eight dividers, giving this yearbook a unique and personal touch.

			<p>In order to increase sales, I designed a few advertisements. These are samples of what were used on social media and printed on flyers.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The intricate pages of our book hold testament to our countless faults, experimentations, problem-solving, collaborations, quarrels, disputes, compromises and all-nighters. Pages falling out of the yearbooks was our last problem, and we solved it by confronting the publisher, who gave away a hundred free copies to teachers and faculty. Regardless of our numerous obstacles, what mattered most was the team we’ve become. As we set up our stations to pass out the Yearbooks that we spent a year making, “Come Together” took on another meaning. It also represented our team: a synergy of talent and perspectives; an extraordinary family.</p>
