			<p>Pinpoint is the first crowd-sourced city guide geared for users to explore while traveling, generating recommendations based on the user's location, his/her network, and public data.</p>
			<p>Think about the 3 key scenarios in which you take photos when traveling: experiences, landmarks, and food. Pinpoint enables you to see what photos your friends have posted in these categories as you walk about the city. Data from your network will be prioritized first, but recommendatoins can also come from public data and matching your habits/interests with those of other individuals.</p>

			<p>Pinpoint creates photo pins out of photos that users upload to the app, which either be imported from the user's library or taken directly within the app. The app uses the geologcation metadata of the photo to create a "photopin" which is placed on the map.</p>
			<p>After uploading photopins, the user can choose to tag or categorize these photos, creating "pinlists" such as "beaches" or "my bucketlist" or "trip itinerary." Pinlists can be made up of photopins uploaded by the user and reppined photos from other users and even other pinlists, allowing more flexibility in use cases. By organizing photopins, users can browse the app with greater efficiency, and Pinpoint can utilize the organized data for machine-learning purposes, giving other users better recommendations.</p>
			<p>The app is split into three parts: explore, discover, and my pins. Explore is Yelp-esque allowing a user to search near an area for something he or she has in mind. Discover takes form of a feed, and solves the problem where a user may not know what he or she wants to do by giving recommendations, such as "it's a good beach day," and friends updates. My pins allows the user to collect his or her own photopins or repin photopins from other users, then organize these collections for future reference.</p>
			<p>With so much data flowing in, Pinpoint can allow companies to create pinlists for, lets say, each coffeeshop in its chain. Companies can also advertise by creating photopins that are placed on the map and recommended to users. Stores and restaurants can allow users to purchase items based on photos of products uploaded by anyone. Finally, an organized form of the data can give companies a bigger picture of how users interact in the real world, essentially providing analytics for users' movements and behaviors.</p>
